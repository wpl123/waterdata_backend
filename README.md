# waterdata_backend


Extract, transform and load pipeline of catchment rainfall, surface/ground water data from Water NSW and Australian Bureau of Meteorology. 

Looking for groundwater anomalies using Jupytr notebooks with LSTM machine learning of the time series data. Compare predict levels of 2018 â€“ 2020 drought to actual readings looking for deviations.
 

ToDo: Integrate temperature, soil moisture, solar radiation into the ML model training data
